## Introduction

The POI Sematic Map Of Hangzhou is a course project for the course WebGIS Development in ZJU.  We develop a poi sematic map with POI points visualization and user interactions to help to improve people's understanding of their surroundings. 

The project is  developed with a front end powered by Cesium.js and Vue.js, a back end built using Flask, and a database utilizing PostgreSQL. The heatmaps used in the project are stored in GeoServer.
